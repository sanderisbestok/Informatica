	OBJ:
		Access the secret token of Bai Gun.
		If you discover a vulnerability, propose a way to fix this.
		Fixes in source code of the provided tools are prefered.

	ACCESS:
		ssh -p50522 login@37.187.23.81
		password: deep-red-star
		channel id: you will receive this separately

	STARTING POINT:
		A new wave of attacks on our system has originated from the account of
		the renowned Agriculture and Life Sciences professor Bai Gun (bai_gun).
		Even after some delicate persuasion, Bai Gun claims he is not involved.
		We would normally ignore this claim, however, the attacks continued even
		during our discussion with Bai Gun. Since he was physically and mentally
		unable to operate a computer at that time, we want you to investigate.
		
		Find out if there is an unknown vulnerability allowing access to 
		the account of professor Bai Gun. If there is, submit a fix for this
		vulnerability. 
		
		Our system administrator noticed some unexpected guest accounts on our 
		system. While this might be unrelated, we have arranged for access to 
		the 'addguest' tool which creates these accounts. 
		
	UPDATE 1:
		Our system administrator now stronly suspects the `addguest` tool was
		involved, as it was run more than 20 times just prior to the start of
		the new attacks. Find out how the `addguest` tool was used, and 
		propose a fix!
