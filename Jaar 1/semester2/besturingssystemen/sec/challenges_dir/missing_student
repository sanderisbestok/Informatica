	OBJ:	
		Access the secret token of Hoon Mook
		If you discover a vulnerability, propose a way to fix this.
		Fixes in source code of the provided tools are prefered.
				
	ACCESS:
		ssh -p50522 login@37.187.23.81
		password: deep-red-star
		channel id: you will receive this separately

	STARTING POINT:
		The behavior enforcement security force has
		apprehended the student Hoon Mook (mook_hoon),
		suspected to sell secret information to our enemy in
		Taiwan. Sadly, Hoon Mook has passed away before we
		could determine whether he had access to the protected
		information and before we could determine his access
		password.  Your role is to log into his account and
		determine whether the missing student really had
		access to the professor's access token.
		
	UPDATE 1:
		Since our initial report it has been determined Hoon Mook was
		innocent. Attackers gained access to his account after reading
		the /etc/passwd file. Determine how this is possible and provide
		a fix. The system administrator suggested the `passwd` utility 
		could be involved. This utility and it's source code wll be made
		available to you within 48 hours. 
		
	UPDATE 2:
		We discovered our new version of the `passwd` utility uses the 
		outdated and unsecure MD5 algorithm. We do not know how this 
		happened, but rest assured we will find those responsible.
		It is now up to you to make sure the `passwd` utility is fixed.
