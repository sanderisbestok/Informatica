Current version: 2.3.0

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.3.0
2.3.0:1  Highlights are now applied in the order they are listed. This ensures 
	 that the last highlight wins when multiple highlights coincide.
2.3.0:2  Constants in Wisent progams without 0x/0b are now interpreted as 
	 decimal. Reviewed all cases in my component library where this made 
	 a difference.
2.3.0:3  Make all pins/memories Rvalues when processing highlights.
2.3.0:4  Fix a couple of graphics glitches on tools where some paint remained
	 after the tool was quit.


	


================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.9
2.2.9:1	 Scroll at reasonable increment in Executer/Editor with mouse-scroll
2.2.9:2  Zoom in Executer/Editor with CTRL + mouse-scroll
2.2.9:3  Fixed various small graphical redraw glitches (thanks Fuzzer)
2.2.9:4  Improved Editor drawing speed of rubber band and dragging components
2.2.9:5  Gracefully handle spurious mouse release events

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.8
2.2.8:1  Work around java bug 7057507 (where icons are forgotten by the runtime)
	 This fix addresses 2.2.7:2 for real.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.7
2.2.7:1  Unhandled exception dialog. Should produce more reliable exception
	 information.
2.2.7:2  Don't use SimpleBeanInfo.loadImage. Don't know why, but it fails for
	 some users sometimes.
2.2.7:3  Use icons from oxygen both in Editor and Executer. Share common icons.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.6
2.2.6:1  Support for loading Programs in Hardware (for Coachlab)
2.2.6:2  Disable useless buttons when no file loaded in Editor or Executer
2.2.6:3  Fixed a problem with PDF, SVG and EPS graphics. This bug caused
	 text and labels to appear in the wrong place.
2.2.6:4  Fixed mouse-over error message in the Hardware window.
2.2.6:5  Fixed drawing of rectangles without rounded corners. The left-top
	 corner appears incorrectly. Only visible with high zoom.
	================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.5
2.2.5:1  Rudimentary support for Coachlab

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.4
2.2.4:1  More KDE4 logo names. (Using the Oxygen Theme)
2.2.4:2  Work around getNormalizingTransform problems. This should fix the
	 bug that on specific machines the mouse cursor is off when zooming.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.3
2.2.3:1  Adapt to KDE4 logo names. (Some logos got renamed)
2.2.3:2  Suggest component name as default worksheet name,
         thus preventing "X.sim-pl.sim-pl-ws" worksheet filenames.
2.2.3:3  Add tooltip text to all Editor tool buttons
2.2.3.4  Tell user why selecting a component while opening a worksheet fails,
	 and vice versa.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.2
2.2.2:1  Really fixed relative directory resolution.
         Softened over-zealous check
2.2.2:2  Made SIM-PL Java Web Start capable

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.1
2.2.1:1  Fixed relative directory resolution. On Windows, there are multiple
         filesystem roots (they call 'em drives), and so it is not always
         possible to construct a relative path from a file to a base directory.
         We can't do much but resort to absolute paths. So if you have
         subcomponents on C: and you include them in a complex component on D:,
         then your component paths will be absolute and your complex component
         will not be portable.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.2.0
2.2.0:1  WASM now supports multi-word instructions.
2.2.0:2  16 bit Bus architecture added.
2.2.0:3  Editable table cells now commit when the table loses focus.
         (They used to remain in edit mode instead.)
         Affected tables are the property table in the Editor, and the
         instance editor tables in the Executer.
2.2.0:4  Always display numbers without prefix. Also parse un-prefixed numbers
         using the current number format.
2.2.0:5  Added Harvard Pipeline

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.1.8
2.1.8:1  Flag names containing '.' and ':' as erroneous in editor

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.1.7
2.1.7:1  SAL highlights work like WASM higlights. The instruction last executed
         is highlighted. At the beginning, the first instruction is shown in a
         different colour.
2.1.7:2  Complex components are recompiled whenever a component is saved. The
         resulting log is displayed in that component's error panel.
2.1.7:3  Executer does not ask whether you want to save the worksheet.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.1.6
2.1.6:1  Fixed NullpointerException in comparing newly opened component to
         existing components. If an unnamed component was present, a nullpointer
         exception was thrown (and no feedback to GUI-only users shown).
2.1.6:2  Properly remember Editor font
2.1.6:3  Default Program Editor font set to 12 pts.
2.1.6:4  Added zoom level 12.5% to TSD, removed 1600%.
2.1.6:5  Removed "Schedule" button. We now directly place values in the
         storage that is being edited.
2.1.6:6  Fixed bug caused by not absolutifying command-line worksheets argument.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.1.5
2.1.5:1  Understand offset specifiers in the 5th (instruction compilation) pass.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.1.4
2.1.4:1  Change wording of Editor's "Open..." tooltip to
         "Edit an existing component"
2.1.4:2  Make Executer treat a 1st command line argument as a worksheet and not
         a component.  Thus we open an existing worksheet, not create one anew.
2.1.4:3  Added WASMdoc Instruction Set Formatter tool.
2.1.4:4  Editor now keeps track of current stroke and current colour settings. A
         new wire (that does not connect from an existing wire) receives the
         current stroke and colour.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.1.3
2.1.3:1  Set Program Editor and Time Table Dialog title correctly after
         loading worksheet. They used to be put to the title of these windows
         just before saving the worksheet.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.1.2
2.1.2:1  Honor probe (v|h)alignment.
2.1.2:2  Wired pins now display their probes with the correct sign.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.1.1
2.1.1:1  Consistly say Truth Table
2.1.1:2  Fixed random worksheet load error. The problem was that views were not
         *removed* from the root window when they were closed (by clicking 'x').
         the result was that the ViewSerialiser output some view IDs that were
         no longer present in the XML.
2.1.1:3  Fixed bug loading problematic component files (i.e. files for which
         java.io.File.lastModification returns 0L. The code would throw a
         null exception, causing a NullPointerException.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.1.0
2.1.0:1  Data entry in the Executer. The user just clicks a pin, a dialog
         appears asking for a value, and the value is immediately set in the
         simulation.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.0.3
2.0.3:1  The program editor's 'Save As' now updates the filename in the titlebar
2.0.3:2  Integrated all Executer dialogs into a single window using InfoNode's
         GPL docking framework library.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.0.2
2.0.2:1  Corrected TimeSequenceDiagram layout. Under some circumstances (like
         high zoom) the graphs were clipped somewhere to the center of the time.
         Now all graphs are always as wide as the whole window.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.0.1
2.0.1:1  Legacy data file error: Legacy components can include self-loop edges.
         we just ignore these during format conversion.
2.0.1:2  Legacy data file error: Legacy components can reference non-existing
         subcomponent pins. We do have a mechanism to handle that in v2, so we
         just use that. (This means a red cross errormark will be shown)
         We use the subcomponent position for the mark position.
2.0.1:3  Handle zero linewidth correctly. Zero linewidth (in java) means that
         the smallest possible linewidth (1 pixel) will be used. This is
         consistent with very small linewidths (say 0.01), that will also show
         up as single-pixel lines. (Unless they are enlarged enough)
2.0.1:4  Improved mouse selection. Got rid of hard threshold. We now select the
         object whose graphical representation is closest to the cursor. We
         break ties by selecting frontmost objects first.
2.0.1:5  We now bypass the priority queue entirely for internal arrays. This was
         necessary to implement caching. It is a general improvement though, for
         it allows for cleaner modelling. It is also faster.
2.0.1:6  Fixed a division by zero in round-ractangle distance computation code.
2.0.1:7  Added Cut/Copy/Paste menu items in Program Editor menu. I don't know
         how to disable them appropriately though. They are always enabled now.
2.0.1:8  Image outputting from executer always drew both probe stubs, value-
         labels and pin-labels. Now we never draw probe stubs, and draw the
         other to according to the menu selection.
2.0.1:9  We now allow WASM typecasting of identifiers. E.g. we can write
         LI $1, addr/number
         Typecasting used to be only available for number constants.
2.0.1:10 Handle open request (double click) on non-resolved (red rectangle)
         subcomponents. We interpreted them as re-read requests.
2.0.1:11 Corrected init() sequence. Now we first execute all INIT events, then
         recompute all wires, and finally send INPUT_CHANGE events to all
         components. Steps one and three used to be merged, which resulted in
         incorrect behaviour if the INIT event changed the value of an output.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.0.0

2.0:1   Wires can now be selected in the Executer. Clicking a wire once adds it
        to the TimeSequenceDialog. Clicking it twice removes it again. This is
        the same behaviour as for pins.
2.0:2   Editor supports save-as as expected.
2.0:3   Editor supports removal of subcomponents. All incoming wires are
        deleted.
2.0:4   New Logo. Hence new splash screen.
2.0:5   Tools now provide tooltips on the component view.
2.0:6   Wires do now have a name.
2.0:7   Replaced "Export" button by "Save" button in Editor toolbar
2.0:8   Re-enabled Help menu item of Editor
2.0:9   Added "Web Page" menu item  to the "Help" menu of Editor and Executer
2.0:10  New file format. Old components are converted when loaded.
2.0:11  Probes can now be placed on wires (yellow) or on pins (pinkish). This
        makes a difference in the case of wires with multiple senders. The wire
        displays the so called wired-or of the senders, while the sender pins
        themselves display their own output.
2.0:12  Constants are now allowed as memory addresses in the WASM file format.
        For example, if $1 is a constant, one could write
            $1: WORD var 100
        as a memory initialiser line. The variable name may be omitted.
2.0:13  SubComponents are now constructed by first choosing a file, and then
        filling in the required fields. Before, one had to provide the file
        name as one of the construction properties. The current behaviour is
        identical to that of SIM-PL v1.
2.0:14  Editor tabs remain sorted  alphabetically by Component name at all times
2.0:15  Double-clicking a subcomponent opens it
2.0:16  Open Editor maximised
2.0:17  Pin labels can now be positioned by dragging the pin-tool. The
        reasonably sane default position is still available, by merely clicking.
2.0:18  Moving labels and pins at the same time does not cause labels to be
        moved double distance anymore.
2.0:19  Use the ".sim-pl" extension for component files, instead of the much
        too general ".xml". This allows component files to be associated to
        SIM-PL by file managers.
2.0:20  Removed color field from PinDialog. Pins receive their color
        automatically, based on their type.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.0.beta-13
2.0.beta-13.1  Font editor
2.0.beta-13.2  Removed (unimplemented) XML tab. The other tab (GUI) was the only
               tab left, I replaced the entire JTabbedPane with the GUI
                    JScrollPane. This gives us some nice extra screen space.
2.0.beta-13.3  Fixed a bug in the compilation error table. Clicking on a line
               caused an exception. It now takes you to the tree-node that
                    generated the compilation error, as intended.
2.0.beta-13.4  Saving files to different directories now works.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.0.beta-12
2.0.beta-12.1  Unconnected pins now automatically receive probes in the Executer
               Before this fix, only complex inputs received probes
2.0.beta-12.2  Settings -> "View Values" and "View Labels" work again
2.0.beta-12.3  You can now move selected components a grid step with the
               using the keyboard. I was unable to map the arrow keys to this
               movement, as they are already claimed by the scroll panel. I
               chose 'w', 'a', s' and 'd', the 'mirrored' keypad on the left.
2.0.beta-12.4  You can now specify autocast rules in WASM definition files.
2.0.beta-12.5  WASM highlights work again (they were disabled somewhere
               in the transition to 2.0)
2.0.beta-12.6  I implemented the 16 bit Harvard processor (using amongst others
               a horizontally flipped multiplexor and an arrow symbol in text)
2.0.beta-12.7  probe value labels are now 1 point wider, they used to look too
               short on the right hand side
2.0.beta-12.8  Put grid customisation options in the Editor settings menu.
2.0.beta-12.9  Included BUGS file in distribution package

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.0.beta-11
2.0.beta-11.1  set probe render stroke back to default in graphics exporter
2.0.beta-11.2  Stroke properties are now saved to XML file.
2.0.beta-11.3  Stroke properties dialog displays correctly.

================================================================================
Improvements in version 2.0.beta-10
2.0.beta-10.1  correctly draw probes (with basic stroke of width 1)
2.0.beta-10.2  set default font to Serif 14pt
2.0.beta-10.3  fix for "closing anything but the last tab triggers an exception"
               this bug is a consequence of Java bug 6368047. Used workaround
2.0.beta-10.4  Tabs are shown in alphabetical, instead of 'random', order
               note: tabs in lower tab-runs come before all tabs in higher runs
2.0.beta-10.5  Fixed multi-bit wire simulation (replaced AND_BIN with AND_BIT)
2.0.beta-10.6  Resizing New Action window resizes text component properly
2.0.beta-10.7  Stroke editor now respects previous join & line end settings
2.0.beta-10.8  Upgraded to castor 1.0.3
2.0.beta-10.9  Explicitly set xml encoding to ISO-8859-1. This
               solves the '\le character becomes ? character on save' bug.
