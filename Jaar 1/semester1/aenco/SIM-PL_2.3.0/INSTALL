1. Requirements
======================================================================
SIM-PL requires at least
-  Java^{TM} 2 Platform Standard Edition 5.0. (J2SE 5.0)
   Sun provides gratis implementations of this platform here
     http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
   SIM-PL has not been tested with other implementations of this 
   platform.

-  A decent box. SIM-PL runs fine on
   - 1.5 GHz processor
   - 512 MB ram
   SIM-PL has not been tested under much lower specs.



2. Deployment
======================================================================
Just unzip the SIM-PL archive somewhere, and you're done! (This is one
of the advantages of being a pure Java application) 


3. Running SIM-PL
======================================================================
The archive extracted under (2.) contains two executable jar files
  - Executer.jar
  - Editor.jar
Each of these starts the corresponding application. SIM-PL can be
invoked from the command-line using 
  java -jar Executer.jar    or   java -jar Editor.jar
