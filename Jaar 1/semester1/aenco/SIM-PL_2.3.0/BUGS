WON'T FIX
#1  the truth-table functionality does not work for components for which
	the propagation delay equals the preferred cycle length.


SOLVED
#2	Deleting a subcomponent in the editor causes all wires connected to it
	to point to (0,0).


SOLVED
#3	Probes do not move when their wire is moved.


SOLVED
#4	When SIM-PL looks for a sub-component, it prefers the (edited)
	component in memory over the component on disk. This causes
	"Save As..." to work unexpected. Typical use: one opens a component,
	changes it a little and then performs a "Save As...". Currently, all
	other components that contain the original component display the
	changed version of the component. This even when the original is
	closed, and changes discarded.

SOLVED
#5a	Not all property editors are fully functional. In particular
	- fill dialog has no configurable transparency
	- stroke dialog: example drawing could be improved

WON'T FIX
#5b	Not all property editors are fully functional. In particular
	- fill dialog has no configurable transparency
	- stroke dialog: example drawing could be improved


SOLVED
#6	Moving pins and labels causes labels to be moved twice.


SOLVED
#7	Loose outputs do not get probes automatically



SOLVED
#8	Settings -> {"View values", "View pin labels"} in Executer do not
	work anymore.


SOLVED
#9	Chances in text of some component are not reflected in components that
	include it.
