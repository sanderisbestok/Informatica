Execute one of the following commands in
your SIM-PL installation directory:

 java -jar Editor.jar

(Double) clicking on one of these icons in your
GUI filebrowser should do this for you automatically.

Notes on converting Assembler headers to WASM
- jump offsets were automatically computed by the Assembler, 
  but this is no longer the case in WASM. The old mechanism has
  been replaced by a variable "self", that contains the address
  of the current instruction. Example: (the intersting part is 
  the last WSDL statement)

<Assembler>
#instructiondefinition BEQ      BRANCH2  "OP=0b00110; ALU = 0x2;  RS = rs; RT = rt; RD = 0; OFFS = offs;"

<WASM>
.instructiondefinition BEQ =    BRANCH2  "OP=0b00110; ALU = 0x2;  RS = rs; RT = rt; RD = 0; OFFS = offs-self;"


- lists of fields and parameters are now enclosed in square brackets:
- what was previously called instructionformat is now split into two:
  * an opcodepartition. This was repeated many times, and is now factored out.
  * the new instructionformat, referencing an opcodefield and adding arguments.

- WASM requires equality signs in declarations, between names and definitions.
